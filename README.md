#Optimal Portfolio Allocation

This project determines the optimal allocation of assets in an investment portfolio using brute force and dynamic programming algorithms. It compares their efficiency and runtime
to make it easy to understand Imagine you work at a prestigious investment firm, tasked with the challenging job of maximizing your clients' returns while carefully managing their risk levels.
Your goal is to determine the optimal way to allocate investments across various assets, each with its own expected return and risk.
To achieve this, you decide to employ two different strategies: brute force and dynamic programming. Both approaches aim to find the best mix of assets, but they do so in very different ways.
